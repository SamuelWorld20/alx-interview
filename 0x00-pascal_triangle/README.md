# Project: 0x00-pascal_triangle

This project implements an algorithm to generate Pascal's Triangle, a mathematical concept named after Blaise Pascal. It's a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it, forming a symmetrical pattern with various applications in combinatorics and probability.

## Features

Generates Pascal's Triangle for a specified number of rows.
Handles edge cases (empty triangle for non-positive input).
Potentially supports customization (e.g., printing specific rows, formatting options) based on future development.
