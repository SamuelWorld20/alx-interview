#0x05-nqueens
This directory contains code for solving the N-Queens problem.

##Description
- The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle where the goal is to place n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other (diagonally, horizontally, or vertically).

- This code implements a backtracking algorithm to find all possible solutions for a given board size (n).
